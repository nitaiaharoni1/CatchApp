Swap endianness in byte arrays.

- Works in Node.js and in the browser
- Works with **Array** and **Uint8Array**
- Works with any byte offset
- Bytes can be represented as strings
- The input array is modified in-place.

## Install
```
npm install endianness
```

## Example
```javascript
const endianness = require("endianness");

// Swap endianness of one 64-bit value:
endianness([64, 9, 33, 251, 84, 68, 45, 24], 8);
// returns [24, 45, 68, 84, 251, 33, 9, 64]

// Swap endianness of two 24-bit values:
endianness(["00", "00", "80", "ff", "ff", "7f"], 3),
// returns ["80", "00", "00", "7f", "ff", "ff"];
```

## Use
```javascript
/**
 * Swap the endianness of units of information in a byte array.
 * The original array is modified in-place.
 * @param {!Array<number>|!Array<string>|Uint8Array} bytes The bytes.
 * @param {number} offset The number of bytes of each unit of information.
 */
function endianness(bytes, offset) {}
```

## Browser
```html
<script src="endianness-min.js"></script>
<script>
    endianness([64, 9, 33, 251, 84, 68, 45, 24], 8);
    // returns [24, 45, 68, 84, 251, 33, 9, 64]
</script>
```
