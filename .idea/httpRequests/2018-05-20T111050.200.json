The Fédération Cynologique Internationale recognizes 337 pure dog breeds.\nOther uses of the term breed when referring to dogs may include pure breeds, cross-breeds, mixed breeds and natural breeds."},"Dog":{"title":"Dog","url":"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dog","summery":"The domestic dog (Canis lupus familiaris when considered a subspecies of the gray wolf or Canis familiaris when considered a distinct species) is a member of the genus Canis (canines), which forms part of the wolf-like canids, and is the most widely abundant terrestrial carnivore. The dog and the extant gray wolf are sister taxa as modern wolves are not closely related to the wolves that were first domesticated, which implies that the direct ancestor of the dog is extinct. The dog was the first species to be domesticated and has been selectively bred over millennia for various behaviors, sensory capabilities, and physical attributes.\nTheir long association with humans has led dogs to be uniquely attuned to human behavior and they are able to thrive on a starch-rich diet that would be inadequate for other canid species. New research seems to show that dogs have mutations to equivalent genetic regions in humans where changes are known to trigger high sociability and somewhat reduced intelligence. Dogs vary widely in shape, size and colors. Dogs perform many roles for people, such as hunting, herding, pulling loads, protection, assisting police and military, companionship and, more recently, aiding handicapped individuals and therapeutic roles. This influence on human society has given them the sobriquet \"man's best friend\".","image":"https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/d/d9/Collage_of_Nine_Dogs.jpg"}}
